Tic Tac Toe

This is simple Tic Tac Toe game.
It has two modes: singleplayer and multiplayer.
In singleplayer mode, player is facing an opponent, which is using random fields to make his move.
In multiplayer mode, players are making their moves one after another. 

In a future I will add a minimax() algorithm, that is making the best possible move. I will also make GUI with Tkinter or PyGame.
